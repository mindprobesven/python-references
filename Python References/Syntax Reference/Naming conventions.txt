# Package and Module Names
Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability.
processlist
process_list

# Class Names
Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
MyClass

# Exception Names
CapWords convention. However, you should use the suffix "Error" on your exception names (if the exception actually is an error).
MyError
FileProcessError

# Function Names
Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
my_function

# Variable Names
Variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
my_variable

# Method Names and Instance Variables
Lowercase, with words separated by underscores
Use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance variables.
To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to invoke Python's name mangling rules.
my_method()
my_instance_variable
_some_private_method

# Constants
All capital letters with underscores separating words.
